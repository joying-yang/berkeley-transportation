                          The theme of mobility is present in the topic of public transportation because it allows access to various locations for many people. It connects people to each other and creates community through each unique and shared experience. Public transportation is a physical manifestation of each city’s history and culture. One can see the changes in infrastructure as they travel from Oakland to Berkeley or Berkeley into San Francisco. Within each city, the transportation systems affect the experience of its residents and visitors. Cities like Manhattan and NYC are widely connected, as well as DC, compared to a city like Los Angeles which is built around their freeways and is more car focused.

We’d also like to bring up the theme of mobility in a different light regarding the city of Berkeley, which is home to the #1 public university in the country, University of California, Berkeley. This institution has immense power to change the trajectory of its students’ lives, specifically those from underrepresented communities. Many students of color and first generation- low income students attend the university to improve their socioeconomic status and support their families once they graduate. The theme of mobility is present as students work for a better future.
