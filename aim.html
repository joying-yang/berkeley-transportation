                          The modernization in the United States undoubtedly resulted in many areas becoming connected by transportation systems and housing while at the same time contributing to isolating communities with different races, wealth, and levels of employment. These disparities mirror racial segregation; the Bay Area's transit services disproportionately focus on white inter-city commuters rather than minority riders who travel within their city.
<br><br>
The development of public transportation in the Bay Area and its accompanying racial discrimination is intertwined not only with the white flight in the Bay Area but also with urban renewal goals. These redevelopment goals often included clearing off "slums"; in particular,
BART and the road infrastructure have increased segregation by cutting through or cutting out neighborhoods in cities like Oakland and San Francisco. According to BART, GM and Bechtel: Protecting Property Values in the San Francisco Financial District by John Gibler, BART officials describe West Oakland as a slum "both to mitigate BART's negative impacts on the community, and to argue that Blacks would benefit from better links to suburban jobs, stores, and schools" (Gibler 26).
<br><br>
Additionally, with the development of the BART, much of the public's attention has been diverted from the AC Transit, one of the few transport systems that support primarily a minority group of commuters. According to the article Confronting Inequality in Metropolitan Regions, the result of this discriminatory funding, minority communities continue to struggle with immobility within their community (Marcantonio 1020). The policies that force residents out of their homes and the extensive infrastructure that runs through neighborhoods – such as the Richmond line built on an “elevated earthen mound that local critics called the Richmond ‘wall’” –   restrict access to employment, educational, and social opportunities (Gibler 25).
<br><br>
While newer transportation infrastructure such as BART successfully connects urban and suburban communities, the planning and decisions of these new systems rest on the assumption of colorblindness- that racism and discrimination only exist if legally supported. According to this view, race and ethnicity should bear no effect on equality and fairness (Race, The Power of an Illusion). However, this assumption reveals a highly superficial understanding of history and neglects the harrowing experiences and the deeply rooted attitudes of minority groups: “To combat racism, we need to identify and remedy social policies and institutional practices that advantage some groups at the expense of others” (Race, The Power of an Illusion). BART, for example, fails to improve and support the mobility of minority communities; it fails to transport blue-collar workers to their workplace, which is largely distinct from the business and tech districts of a white high-earning individual. Though subtly, the BART thus etches lines between neighborhoods and worsens the segregation in jobs, mobility, and housing.
